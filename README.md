# Network-Design-Network-Topology
Project Network diagramprovides a visual representation of the network and integrates information such as physical connections; quantity, type, and location of all devices and endpoints; IP addressing; and security processes and architecture.  Plan to map physical connections. assets, endpoints, users, devices, LANs, and other network elements
